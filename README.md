   ```

4. **Start PostgreSQL database:**
   ```bash
   # Using Docker Compose (recommended for development)
   docker-compose up postgres -d
   
   # OR install PostgreSQL locally and create database
   createdb koinonia
   ```

5. **Run the server:**
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   # Create .env.local file
   echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api" > .env.local
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:3000`

**Available Pages:**
- `/` - Home dashboard (landing page for guests, dashboard for authenticated users)
- `/login` - User login
- `/register` - User registration
- `/quests` - Quest listing (coming soon)
- `/leaderboard` - User rankings (coming soon)

2. **Visit `http://localhost:3000`**
3. **Create a new account or use sample credentials:**
   - Sample users have password: `password123`
   - Admin user: `admin` / `admin123`

4. **Test key features:**
   - User registration and login
   - Browse available quests on dashboard
   - View leaderboard with sample data
   - Navigate between pages
