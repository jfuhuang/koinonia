## 📋 Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Go 1.21+
- PostgreSQL (local or Docker)
- Git

### Backend Setup (Go API)

1. **Navigate to backend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your database credentials
   ```

4. **Start PostgreSQL database:**
   ```bash
   # Using Docker Compose (recommended for development)
   docker-compose up postgres -d
   
   # OR install PostgreSQL locally and create database
   createdb koinonia
   ```

5. **Run the server:**
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

The API server will start on `http://localhost:8080`

**Available API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `GET /api/quests` - Get all quests
- `POST /api/quests/:id/submit` - Submit quest completion
- `GET /api/leaderboard` - Get leaderboard
- `GET /api/profile` - Get user profile
- Admin endpoints for quest management and submission approval

### Frontend Setup (Next.js)

1. **Navigate to frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   # Create .env.local file
   echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api" > .env.local
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:3000`

**Available Pages:**
- `/` - Home dashboard (landing page for guests, dashboard for authenticated users)
- `/login` - User login
- `/register` - User registration
- `/quests` - Quest listing (coming soon)
- `/leaderboard` - User rankings (coming soon)
- `/profile` - User profile (coming soon)

### Database Schema

The application uses the following main models:

**Users Table:**
- Authentication and profile information
- Points tracking
- Role-based access (user/admin)

**Quests Table:**
- Different quest types (scripture, side_quest, trivia, encouragement)
- Difficulty levels and point values
- Content specific to quest type

**Submissions Table:**
- User quest submissions
- Admin approval workflow
- Media attachments support

**Sample Data:**
The backend includes sample quests and users. Default admin credentials:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

## 🧪 Testing the Application

1. **Start both backend and frontend servers**
2. **Visit `http://localhost:3000`**
3. **Create a new account or use sample credentials:**
   - Sample users have password: `password123`
   - Admin user: `admin` / `admin123`

4. **Test key features:**
   - User registration and login
   - Browse available quests on dashboard
   - View leaderboard with sample data
